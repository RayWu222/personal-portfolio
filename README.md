# minimal-portfolio

This is a portfolio website showcasing my skills. Here the link: https://raywu-portfolio.netlify.app/

#How It's Made:#

Tech used: HTML, Tailwind, JavaScript, Vite, React

Why was this stack chosen?
I wanted to work with something I knew but also venture into new territories, so I went with React for this project. Plus, I've been hearing a lot about Tailwind CSS, so I figured why not give it a shot? And voila, this portfolio website is the result of that curiosity and exploration.

#Lesson Learned:#
*The difference between Tailwind and CSS, can just use className for styling and no need for seperate CSS file for styling 
*Hosting a react website using netlify
*Vite, and the difference between it and the normal create-react-app. Vite is faster in the long run.

#Think that can be improve on:#
*Email validator
*Add github action for continous delievery
